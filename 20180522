2.When you want to use the extension functions:
VirtualBox - 拡張パック（Extension Pack）のダウンロード・インストール
And you just need to run it. And vertualbox will help ou to install the new functions automatically.

3.Never close a virtual machine by forcement. Because you will have to install the system all again cuz you made a system crash.
It takes you a long time.
